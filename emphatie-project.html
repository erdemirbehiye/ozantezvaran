          Imagine you are a device in a community of interconnected devices. How
          would you want to organize with others? What is the purpose of
          receiving, transferring, storing, and processing data for
          yourself/your community? Exploring these questions raises some of the
          shortcomings that arise in organizations, such as misinterpretation,
          and failure to transfer information. A Mesh/Mess Of Beings is a design
          of an ecosystem of non-human agencies just for themselves without
          considering the human benefit. It speculates on absurd-yet-plausible
          relationships between familiar electronic devices that are in
          conversation with each other. Beings that impose fictional functions
          on the processing of information envision new possible scenarios for
          ways of being together. The devices we demand to be user-friendly are
          becoming citizens in their own societies. Through changes in their
          functions and aesthetics, the work points to the possibility of
          political interventions in the design of human organizations.
